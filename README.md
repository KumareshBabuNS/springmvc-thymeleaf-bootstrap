springmvc-thymeleaf-bootstrap
=============================
This is a simple "seed" project to be used as the basis for new projects,
especially sample applications.

It is a Spring Boot-enabled project that employs Spring MVC, Thymeleaf
templates, and Twitter Bootstrap. It *roughly* recreates the behavior of 
the Spring ToolSuite Spring MVC Template project. 

After cloning this project, you can build and run the project just as you
would any Spring Boot-enabled Java project:

```sh
$ gradle build
$ java -jar build/libs/mvc-thymeleaf-bootstrap-0.1.0.jar
```

To use this as a "seed" for your own projects, delete the .git directory,
commit it to your own repository, then develop on top of it.
